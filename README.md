The Way Towards Data Science


I'm moving commit my data science work, especially those with modeling tasks to platform Jovian, where I can record logs & make comparisons between different versions, you can check @ https://jovian.ml/sooner0931

Hooray! Yes you're right, you can find me on most of platforms by suffixing "sooner0931".
